# Udacity-Data-Wranging
Project in which I retrieved data using 3 methods:
  reading a csv
  web scraping a tsv
  using an api and json
  
The data was based on the twitter of account "RatemyDogs". It included count of favorites and retweets, tweet id, 
tweet text, the ratings retrieved from the text, data predicting the dog, dog names, among many other details.
